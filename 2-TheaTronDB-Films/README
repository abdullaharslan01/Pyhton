About The Program: Thanks to the program, you can find future movie processes that will be useful to you.

How did I find the program name: The name of the program comes from the word Theatron. According to one view; thea means goddess and tron means place, so we reach the meaning of the house of the goddess. According to this view, theater in ancient Greece was not a theater but a purely religious ritual. There are various discussions and theses on this subject. In short: the word meaning the place of sight, the place where something is seen. The word theater is derived from here.
